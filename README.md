# What this filter does

This is a filter for the newspaper website Helsingin Sanomat in Finland. This filter hides
- the weather widget
- ads that are not picked up by the uBlock Origin itself (such as job listings)
- for the subscribers' posts ("Tilaajille" -julkaisut)
- sports (I'm not that interested).

## Making your own filters

If you want to dive into how the uBlock Origin syntax works, you can read the [Static filter syntax](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax) page.
